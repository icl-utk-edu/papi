		When PAPI is run as SUID, often links in /proc are inaccessible. This was
		reported by the guys at CMU. Thanks guys!
		
		The fix is simply to tolerate inaccessible
		/proc information since this doesn't affect library operation at all. In
		this case, the exe_name and full_name are NULL strings, and the memory map
		is empty. Debug error messages are still raised.
		
		The executable name can be empty, as can the memory map.

		Hi Phil,
		
		That worked, mostly.  I setuid/setgid all the relevant libraries, which
		then got me to a PAPI_library_init error reporting a system call error.
		I ran papiex with -d, and it reported a permission denied problem in
		readlink().  PAPI_library_init examines /proc/SOME_PID/exe to see the
		actual binary path, but procfs is very stingy about who can view that
		symlink.  I couldn't figure out an elegant way to get /proc to allow a
		library, even when setuid-root, to see the symlinks in /proc.  Maybe
		you've got a better work around, but...

		Last week, I spent some time tracking this down

		use point, it works.

	* p3_events.c 1.43:
		Cleaned up Opteron events per Brian Wylie's suggestions:
		
		I've been using PAPI on Opteron and have encountered a few oddities with
		the preset definitions: in particular, I'm looking at p3_events.c v1.42
		in the CVS repository:
		
		PAPI_L1_ICH = IC_MISS - IC_SYS_REFILL - IC_L2_REFILL
		This definition seems to always yield zero and is presumably incorrect.
		A comment in the CVS log (from AMD) suggests replacing IC_MISS (81h)
		with IC_FETCH (80h), which seems much more reasonable.
		
		Similar comments in the CVS log, which sound like recommendations from
		AMD, are not to include INValid refills from L2 and system, and indeed
		v1.39 modified the definitions of DC_L2_REFILL_TOT and DC_SYS_REFILL_TOT
		accordingly. Subsequently, however, these definitions were replaced
		with DC_L2_REFILL_MOESI and DC_SYS_REFILL_MOESI which reinstated the
		INValid refills. (This effects a number of the presets.)
		
		I also see other definitions which include INValid refills:
		PAPI_L2_DCW = DC_L2_REFILL_MI
		PAPI_L1_LDM = DC_L2_REFILL_OESI and
		PAPI_L2_LDM = DC_SYS_REFILL_OESI
		and I'm wondering whether the INValid refills should be removed from
		these too.
		
		Can you, or some of the folks at AMD, check these?

		(which happens in ctests/multiplex1).
		3. The patch to papi_internal.c is to ensure that all native events that
		we fail to add during a given call to add_native_events() get cleaned
		out of the NativeInfoArray.  This bug was causing a particular testcase
		to fail for me. In the testcase, I successfully added a couple events,
		then failed while adding a PAPI present event that mapped to 4 native
		events.  This change makes sure we examine all NativeInfoArray event
		entries to see if they failed and need to be removed.

	* Makefile.solaris-ultra 1.59:
	* Makefile.solaris-ultra-64bit 1.13:
		Removed -R argument to shared link, which was putting the wrong path
		in to the run-time loader.
		Removed the -h flag to the shared link, which was (in the 64 bit case)
		setting the wrong name of the library.
		Neither is required.

	* linux-ia64.c 1.118:
		Ooops. Missed a little bug on line 961. Thanks to Shirley for catching this.

	* p4_events.c 1.49:
		Implemented PAPI_L1_ICA and PAPI_L1_ICM per suggestions from Brinkley Sprunt.
		Don't know how to validate whether the counts are reasonable.
		That's left as an exercise for the user.

	* papiStdEventDefs.h 1.31:
		Added some comment spacers to clarify event numbering.

	* p3_events.c 1.42:
	* perfctr-p3.c 1.58:
	* perfctr-p3.h 1.34:
		Modifications to native event tables for Pentium II, III, Athlon and Opteron to
		dynamically generate all combinations of events that support MESI (Intel) or
		MOESI (AMD) bits. Similar to the way that Pentium 4 supports groups and
		modifiers, but MUCH simpler.
		Tested on Pentium III and Opteron. Not tested on Pentium II and Athlon.
		This is in response to Luiz DeRose's request for more flexibility in
		specifying native events on Opteron.
		You're welcome, Luiz.

	* extras.c 1.122:
	* p4_events.c 1.48:
	* papi.c 1.285:
	* papi_protos.h 1.48:
		Changes to address the thread-unsafe behavior of
		_papi_hwd_code_to_{name,descr}().
		Rather than change the calling sequence of these routines in every substrate,
		I changed the way the routines are called from extras.c, wrapping them in PAPI_lock/unlock pairs.
		Pentium 4 was the only substrate that posed a thread risk. That hole has now been plugged.
		Also, other substrates can now engage in the same shenanigans if desired.
		NOTE: This required changes in the calling sequences of two _hwi_ routines.
		These changes are not exposed to the user.

	* linux-ia64.c 1.117:
	* linux-ia64.h 1.40:
	* pfmwrap.h 1.22:
		Fixes for SGI Propack 3 on Altix...
		
		This happens because it's a Perfmon 2 platform + NPTL threads. Got
		rid of those pesky, pesky pids instead of nice little tids.
		
		Working? Who knows...haven't tested. Rick?

		Windows doesn't support %lld formatting.
		Tweak on output format so Windows reports stuff correctly.

	* ftests/ftests_util.F 1.37:
		Minor change in scope of TESTS_QUIET variable so that tests would run quiet on Windows.
		Don't know how/why this ever worked before...
