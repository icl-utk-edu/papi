HOW TO INSTALL PAPI ONTO YOUR SYSTEM
*****************************************************************************

On some of the systems that PAPI supports, you can install PAPI right 
out of the box without any additional setup. Others require drivers or 
patches to be installed first.

The general installation steps are below, but first find your particular 
Operating System's section for any additional steps that may be necessary.

General Installation

1.	Pick the appropriate Makefile.<arch> for your system in the papi 
	source distribution, edit it (if necessary) and compile.

	% make -f Makefile.<arch>

2.	Check for errors. 

	a) Run a simple test case: (This will run ctests/zero)

	% make -f Makefile.<arch> test

	If you get good counts, you can optionally run all the test programs
	with the include test harness. 	This will run the tests in quiet mode, 
	which will print PASSED, FAILED, or SKIPPED. Tests are SKIPPED if the
	functionality being tested is not supported by that platform.

	% make -f Makefile.<arch> fulltest (This will run ./run_tests.sh)

	To run the tests in verbose mode:

	% ./run_tests.sh -v

3.	Create a PAPI binary distribution or install PAPI directly.

	a) To install PAPI libraries and header files from the build tree:

	% make -f Makefile.<arch> PREFIX=<install-dir> install

	Please use an absolute pathname for <install-dir>, not a relative 
	pathname.

	b) To install PAPI manual pages from the build tree:

	% make -f Makefile.<arch> PREFIX=<install-dir> install-man

	c) To install PAPI test programs from the build tree:

	% make -f Makefile.<arch> PREFIX=<install-dir> install-tests

	d) To install all of the above in one step from the build tree:

	% make -f Makefile.<arch> PREFIX=<install-dir> install-all

	e) To create a binary kit, papi-<arch>.tgz:

	% make -f Makefile.<arch> dist



*****************************************************************************
Operating System Specific Installation Steps (In Alphabetical Order by OS)
*****************************************************************************


AIX - IBM POWER3 and POWER4
*****************************************************************************
PAPI is supported on both AIX 4.3.3 for POWER3, and AIX 5.1 for POWER3 
and POWER4. A different make file is used for each of these three 
configurations.

For AIX 4.3.3 - POWER3:
Install Pmtoolkit before compiling PAPI.  Pmtoolkit must be installed as root. 
The file can be downloaded from the following URL:

	http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/aw.nsf/download/pmapi

Installation instructions for PMTOOLKIT on AIX 4.3.3:
1.	Make sure you have AIX 4.3.3 installed.
2.	Store pmtoolkit.latest in /usr/sys/inst.images. 
3.	Type "installp -X -acd /usr/sys/inst.images/pmtoolkit.obj all" to 
	install. This file goes in 
	/usr/lpp/pmtoolkit/doc/pmapi.toolkit.guide.html.
4.	After the installation, run pmloadsvcs as root to load the kernel 
	extension.  
5.	A simple way of testing the installation and load is by running 
	pmcycles. It should return: 
		This machine runs at xxx MHz

**NOTE: Whenever the machine is rebooted, Pmtoolkit must be reloaded. 
This step can be done automatically at boot time by putting the line: 
	% /usr/lpp/pmtoolkit/bin/pmloadsvcs  
at the end of the /etc/rc.net file. **

**NOTE In order to unload the kernel extension, run pmunloadsvcs. **

After the installation of Pmtoolkit, follow the general installation to 
install PAPI, using Makefile.aix-power.

For AIX 5.1 - POWER4:
*****************************************************************************
1.	On AIX 5.x, the bos.pmapi is a product level fileset (part of the OS).
	However, it is not installed by default. Consult your sysadmin to 
	make sure it is installed. 
2.	Follow the general instructions for installing PAPI, using 
	Makefile.aix-power4.

For AIX 5.1 - POWER3:
*****************************************************************************
1.	If you are upgrading from AIX 4.3.x, first unload and uninstall 
	pmtoolkit if it has been installed.
2.	After upgrading to AIX 5.x, consult your sysadmin to make sure the 
	bos.pmapi is properly installed. 
3.	Follow the general instructions for installing PAPI, using 
	Makefile.aix5-power3.

Warning about XLC version 5. PAPI excepts xlc version 6 or greater. Your version
can be determined by running 'lslpp -a -l | grep -i xlc'. If you have version
5, you need to build with 'CC_SHR="-G -r"' on the make line, like this:
	
	> make -f Makefile.aix5-power3 CC_SHR="-G -r"

Linux - Alpha
*****************************************************************************
PAPI on Alpha Linux requires the iprobe driver patch from Compaq/HP, which 
requires a minimum kernel version of 2.1.132. For details on installing this 
kernel driver see the README at: 
ftp://ftp.support.compaq.com/private/alpha-tools-software/iprobe/readme.txt
The patch itself is in the papi/src/alpha-linux directory.
Once the driver is properly installed, follow the general instructions for 
installing PAPI, using Makefile.linux-alpha.


Linux - Itanium I & II
*****************************************************************************
PAPI on Itanium Linux links to libpfm, version 2.0 requires a kernel version
of 2.4.x, version 3.0 requires kernel version 2.6.x or higher. The kernel
version is detected automatically in the Rules.libpfm file. 

To build for this platform, use the Makefile.linux-libpfm-<processor> makefile,
where processor is either itanium or itanium2.

To build with a different version of PFM than is detected by the makefile: 
(version 2.0 or 3.0)

set VERSION=2.0 or VERSION=3.0 on the make line.

To build with an installed libpfm:

set the PFM_PREFIX flag on the make line.

To build with an uninstalled libpfm not inside the PAPI source tree:

set the PFM flag on the make line.

Linux/x86 - Intel and AMD
*****************************************************************************
Linux/x86 requires that the kernel be patched and recompiled with the PerfCtr
patch. The required patches and complete installation instructions are 
provided in the papi/src/perfctr-x.y directory. Please see the INSTALL file
in that directory. 

Do not forget, you also need to build your kernel with APIC support in order
for hardware overflow to work. This is very important for accurate statistical
profiling ala gprof via the hardware counters.

So, when you configure your kernel to build with PERFCTR as above, make
sure you turn on APIC support in the "Processor type and features" section.
This should be enabled by default if you are on an SMP, but it is disabled
by default on a UP. 

In our 2.4.x kernels:
> grep PIC /usr/src/linux/.config
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y

You can verify the APIC is working after rebooting with the new kernel
and running the 'perfex -i' command found in the perfctr/examples/perfex
directory.

PAPI supports 2 versions of PerfCtr. The 2.4.x series and the 2.6.x series.
By default, PAPI assumes 2.6.x. You can change this by setting the
VERSION flag on the make line to either 2.4.x or 2.6.x.

make -f Makefile.linux-<processor> VERSION=2.4.x

*- IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PATCHED YOUR KERNEL AND/OR INSTALLED PERFCTR -*

WARNING: You should always use a PerfCtr distribution that has been distributed
with a version of PAPI or your build will fail. The reason for this is that
PAPI builds a shared library of the Perfctr runtime, on which libpapi.so
depends. PAPI also depends on the .a file, which it decomposes into component
objects files and includes in the libpapi.a file for convenience. If you
install a new perfctr, even a shared library, YOU MUST REBUILD PAPI to get
a proper, working libpapi.a. 

If you have already installed PerfCtr under <prefix> then:

make -f Makefile.linux-<processor> PERFCTR_PREFIX=<prefix>

If you have a different PerfCtr source tree other than the ones in papi/src
AND you have not performed a 'make install' in that directory:

make -f Makefile.linux-<processor> PERFCTR=<PerfCtr source tree location>

MIPS - IRIX 6.5
*****************************************************************************
No additional steps are required to get PAPI working on IRIX. Follow the 
general installation guide, and everything should work.


Solaris 8 - Ultrasparc
*****************************************************************************
The only requirement for Solaris is that you must be running version 2.8 or 
newer.  As long as that requirement is met, no additional steps are required 
to get PAPI working and you can follow the general installation guide.

Tru64 UNIX - Alpha
*****************************************************************************
On Tru64 UNIX, PAPI uses a service called "Dynamic Access to DCPI
Data (DADD)" to acquire performance data. DADD is a service provided
by the HP Continuous Profiling Infrastructure (DCPI.) DCPI with DADD
is not part of the PAPI distribution and is available from Hewlett
Packard. Contact dcpi@hp.com for further details.

PAPI support using the PFM device driver is deprecated and will be
replaced by DCPI with DADD.


Unicos - Cray 
*****************************************************************************
No additional steps are required to get PAPI working on Unicos.
Follow the general installation guide, and everything should work.


Windows XP/2000 - Intel
*****************************************************************************
**NOTE:  A driver bug currently prevents PAPI from running successfully on 
AMD processors.**

Download the self-installing executable from the PAPI site.
Double-click it and follow the prompts.
The installer requires administrator privileges, since it installs a device 
driver to access the counters.
This executable includes binaries for the library, device driver, examples, 
and perfometer as well as source code for the examples.
The general installation instructions are irrelevant for Windows.
