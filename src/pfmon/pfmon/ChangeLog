	  from system wide sessions

2002-12-06 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

2002-12-04 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* updated entire source code to reflect change in the 
	  library for pfmlib_param_t and pfm_dispatch_events().

2002-12-03 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* cleanup management of per-event instruction set in pfmon_itanium.c
	  and pfmon_itanium2.c.
	* got rid of gen_priv_levels() in pfmon_util.c, consolidated in
          pfmon.c
	* fix a bug in the drange plm setting in both pfmon_itanium.c
	  and pfmon_itanium2.c
	* added restriction that we cannot mix per-event priv level
	  with any range restrictions.

	* added missing range restriction section in pfmon_itanium2.txt

2002-11-27 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* cleanup the sampling output formats, especially compact
	* simplified management of entry number when sampling.

2002-11-21 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* added --smpl-print-counts option. By default counts are not
	  printed when sampling unless this option is specified.
	* added warning in compact sampling output mode  header when
	  randomization is not supported by kernel. We keep the same 
	  number of columns but the value is zero instead of the initial
	  value of first overflowed PMD.
	* added --trigger-start-delay option to both per-process and
	  system-wide modes.

2002-11-20 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* separated the library, include files, and examples
	  from pfmon.

2002-11-19 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* added support for monitoring at priv level 1 2
	* added support for sampling period randomization (--smpl-periods-random)
	* fix to forbid using a command and timeout to delimit system-wide session
	* fixed signal/ptrace problem when using --trigger-address option in
	  per-process mode. We must resend all signals back to the monitored 
	  task unless it is SIGTRAP.

2002-11-14 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* cleanup the DPRINT/debug_print macros. Added dprintf() to pfmon_util.c

2002-11-11 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* fixed a sampling buffer bug in which the last set of samples
	  may be reported twice for non-blocking (default) per-process
	  sampling sessions. This is a kernel perfmon buf in 2.4.18 and
	  2.4.19. Need a way to identify each set of samples.

2002-09-25 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* fixed invalid order of parameters for warning() all sampling format
	  validate routines.

2002-09-16 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* added generation counter to barrier structure in pfmon/pfmon_system.c
	  to avoid possible wake-up race condition.

2002-08-14 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* fixed a problem when using BTB on Itanium2, it would not setup
	  pmc12 correctly

	* system wide support for UP and SMP
	* Itanium address range restriction support
	* possibility to sample on any events (not just Itanium EAR/BTB)
	* lots of new command line options
	* a new set of examples  and simple test programs
	* a new compact sampling format
	* completely restructured library code: prepare for other CPU models
	* completely restructured pfmon code: prepare for other CPU models
	* a user's guide (1000 lines)
	* updated event names for Itanium (update to latest specs)
	* support for Intel ecc compiler (beta6.0) 
	* support for IA-32 execution monitoring

2001-08-06 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	  perfmon (CONFIG_PERFMON)

	  mode prints.
