This package provides a library, called libpfm, which can be used
to develop monitoring tools which use the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU)
of several modern processors.


This version of libpfm supports:
	- For Intel IA-64 :  Itanium (Merced), Itanium 2 (McKinley, Madison, Deerfield), Itanium 2 9000/9100 (Montecito,Montvale) and Generic
	- For AMD/Intel IA-32 (64 bit mode,X86-64): AMD Opteron (K8, fam 10h), Xeon, Intel Core 2 Duo, Intel Core 2
	- For AMD/Intel IA-32 (32 bit mode, i386) : Pentium II, Pentium Pro, Pentium III, Pentium M/P6, Core Duo/Core Solo, Intel Pentium 4, AMD Opteron (K8,fam 10h)), Intel Core 2
	- For Intel IA-32: architectural perfmon v1, v2, v3
	- For MIPS:  5K, 20K, 25KF, 34K, 5KC, 74K, R10000, R12000, RM7000, RM9000, SB1, VR5432, VR5500, SiCortex ICA9A/ICE9B
	- For Cray: BlackWidow
	- IBM Cell processor
        - For IBM POWER: PPC970, PPC970MP, POWER4+, POWER5, POWER5+, POWER6
	- For Sun Sparc: Ultra12, Ultra3, Ultra3i, Ultra3Plus, Ultra4Plus, Niagara1, Niagara2

The core library is generic and does not depend on the perfmon interface. It is possible to use
it on other operating systems (some adjustments may still be needed).

WHAT'S THERE
-------------
	- the library source code including support for all processors listed above

	- a set of examples showing how the library can be used with the perfmon2
	  version 2.6 or higher kernel interface.

	- a set of older examples for IA-64 only using the legacy perfmon2 interface (v2.0).

	- a set of library header files and the perfmon2 v2.6 kernel interface headers

	- libpfms: a simple library to help setup SMP system-wide monitoring sessions. It comes
	  with a simple example. This library is not part of libpfm.

	- man pages for all the library entry points

	- Python bindings for libpfm and the perfmon interface (experimental).

INSTALLATION
------------
	- edit config.mk to :
		- update some of the configuration variables
		- make your compiler options
		- select which PMU you want to support. Multiple PMU for the same processor architecture
	   	  can be supported by a single library

	- type make
	- type make install

 	- To compile and install the Python bindings, you need to go to the python sub-directory and type
	  make. Python is not systematically built

	- to compile the library for another ABI (e.g. 32-bit x86 on a 64-bit x86) system, you can pass
	  the ABI flag to the compiler as follows (assuming you have the multilib version of gcc):
		$ make OPTION="-m32 -O2"

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
	- to run the programs in the examples subdir, you MUST be using a linux kernel version of
	  2.6.24 or later with the corresponding perfmon new code base patch installed.
	  The patch can be downloaded from:
	  		http://perfmon2.sf.net/

	- On IA-64, the examples in old_interface_ia64_examples work with any 2.6.x kernels.

	- to compile the Python bindings, you need to have SWIG and the python development
	  packages installed

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
	- man pages for all entry points
	- More information can be found on library web site: http://perfmon2.sf.net
