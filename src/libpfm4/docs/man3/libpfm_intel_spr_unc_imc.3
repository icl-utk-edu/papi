.SH DESCRIPTION
The library supports the Intel SapphireRapids Server Integrated Memory Controller (IMC) uncore PMU.

.SH MODIFIERS
The following modifiers are supported on Intel SapphireRapids server IMC uncore PMU:
.TP
.B e
Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a state transition from no occurrence of the event to at least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to one.  This is a boolean modifier.
.TP
.B t
Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the counter counts the number
of IMC cycles in which the number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
the threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in the range [0:255].
.B i
Invert the threshold (t) test from strictly greater than to less or equal to. This is a boolean modifier.
