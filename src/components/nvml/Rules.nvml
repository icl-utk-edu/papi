# Set default if the root environment variable is not already set.
# Note PAPI_CUDA_ROOT is an environment variable that must be set.
# It is the ONLY environment variable that must be set, all other
# settings are optional.
PAPI_CUDA_ROOT ?= /opt/cuda

# For non-typical system configurations, the following 'runtime overrides' can
# be set, as just a library name, or a full path and name. There cannot be any
# spaces between the double quotes (which must be escaped as \"). An example:

# PAPI_CUDA_CUPTI = \"$(PAPI_CUDA_ROOT)/extras/CUPTI/lib64/libcupti.so\"

# By default, all overrides are empty strings.

# If an override is not an empty string, it must work, or the component will be
# disabled. 

# Both at compile time and run time, the software depends on PAPI_CUDA_ROOT.
# There are three libraries used by the NVML component, they are 
# libcuda.so.1
# libcudart.so.12
# libnvidia-ml.so.1

# The standard installed locations for these libraries, with overrides:
# $(PAPI_CUDA_ROOT)/lib64/libcuda.so.1             #O.R. PAPI_CUDA_MAIN
# $(PAPI_CUDA_ROOT)/lib64/libcudart.so.12          #O.R. PAPI_CUDA_RUNTIME
# $(PAPI_CUDA_ROOT)/lib64/libnvidia-ml.so.1        #O.R. PAPI_NVML_MAIN
# 
# There are many ways to cause these paths to be known. 
# Spack is a package manager used on supercomputers, Linux and MacOS. If Spack
# is aware of CUDA or NVML, it encodes the paths to the necessary libraries.

# The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH encodes a list of paths to search for
# libraries; separated by a colon (:). These paths could be added to
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
#
# Warning: LD_LIBRARY_PATH often contains a list of directories that are
# searched for libraries, some of these may be needed by other packages you are
# using. Always add to LD_LIBRARY_PATH recursively; for example: 
# >export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=someNewLibraryDirectory:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
# which would append the existing LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the new directory you wish
# to add.  Alternatively, you can prepend it: 
# >export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:someNewLibraryDirectory 
# Which will search the existing libraries first, then your new directory.

# You can check on the value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH with 
# >echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# There may be other package managers or utilities, for example on a system with
# modules; the command 'module load cuda' may modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

# A Linux system will also search for libraries by default in the directories
# listed by /etc/ld.so.conf, and /usr/lib64, /lib64, /usr/lib, /lib. 

# OVERRIDES: These are by default empty strings (""), if set they must work.
PAPI_CUDA_MAIN = \"\"
PAPI_CUDA_RUNTIME = \"\"
PAPI_NVML_MAIN = \"\"

# An example of an override:
# PAPI_NVML_MAIN = \"$(PAPI_CUDA_ROOT)/lib64/libnvidia-ml.so.1\"

# Note:  PAPI_CUDA_MAIN and PAPI_CUDA_RUNTIME, if set, will also apply to the
#        CUDA component, which uses the same libraries.

# Note:  If you change these overrides, PAPI should be rebuilt from scratch.
#        From papi/src/
#        make clobber
#        ./configure --with-components="nvml"
#        make  

# OPERATION, per library:
# 1) If an override string is not empty, we will use it explicitly and fail if
# it does not work. This means disabling the component; a reason for disabling
# is shown using the papi utility, papi/src/utils/papi_component_avail

# 2) We will attempt to open the library using the normal system library search
# paths; if Spack is present and configured correctly it should deliver the
# proper library. A failure here will be silent; we will proceed to (3).

# 3) If that fails, we will try to find the library in the standard installed
# locations listed above. If this fails, we disable the component, the reason
# for disabling is shown using the papi utility,
# papi/src/utils/papi_component_avail. 

# DEFFLAGS is the macro defines for the three overrides. In the code we convert
# these to string variables with the following lines:
# static char cuda_main[]=PAPI_CUDA_MAIN;
# static char cuda_runtime[]=PAPI_CUDA_RUNTIME;
# static char nvml_main[]=PAPI_NVML_MAIN;
