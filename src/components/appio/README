SUMMARY

    Application I/O component

DESCRIPTION

    This application I/O component enables PAPI-C to determine
    I/O used by the application. This is to be distinguished
    from system-wide I/O statistics. The goal of this component
    is to help the programmer attribute the I/O (read/write) to
    files and sockets, to the source code.

    Listed below are the events measured by the component:

    Event names
    -----------
      READ_BYTES
      READ_CALLS
      READ_ERR
      READ_INTERRUPTED
      READ_WOULD_BLOCK
      READ_SHORT
      READ_EOF
      READ_BLOCK_SIZE
      READ_USEC
      WRITE_BYTES
      WRITE_CALLS
      WRITE_ERR
      WRITE_SHORT
      WRITE_BLOCK_SIZE
      WRITE_USEC
      OPEN_CALLS
      OPEN_ERR
      OPEN_FDS
      OPEN_USEC

    The component works by intercepting I/O system calls on Linux. At present
    the code uses a features available in libc on Linux, and is unlikely to
    work on other platforms at present. 

    At present the code works for static and dynamic linkage. In the future, 
    if necessary to accomodate a larger number of I/O calls, we may restrict
    support to dynamically linked executables to take advantage of LD_PRELOAD
    for interception.

    The component has been tested on 32 and 64-bit Linux. It's also been tested
    to work for multithreaded programs.

    Limitations and future work:
    ---------------------------
    The most important aspect to note is that the code is likely to only work on
    Linux, given the low-level dependencies on libc features. 

    At present the component intercepts the open(), read(), write(), fread() and fwrite().
    In the future it's envisaged that these will be expanded to cover open(), close(),
    lseek(), select(), etc. 

    The component at present doesn't distinguish between network and file I/O. So,
    any read/writes will count, regardless of whether the underlying descriptor is
    a socket or a file. Similarly, character and block I/O is not distinguished.

    Threads are handled using thread-specific structures in the backend. However, no 
    aggregation is currently performed across threads. There is also NO global structure
    that has the statistics of all the threads. This means the user can call
    a PAPI read to get statitics for a running thread. However, if the thread has
    joined, then it's statistics can no longer be queried. 

    TESTING:
    -------
    Tests lie in the tests/ sub-directory. All but one test take no argument.

    The iozone test (appio_test_iozone) needs arguments just like iozone does.
    It is not built by default as part of the PAPI tests. To build it:
      cd appio/tests; make appio_test_iozone
    An example run for the iozone test could be:
      ./appio_test_iozone -s 100m -r 64 -i 0 -i 1 -t 1
