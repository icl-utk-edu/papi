# About

The Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI) provides tool
designers and application engineers with a consistent interface and methodology
for the use of low-level performance counter hardware found across the entire
compute system (i.e. CPUs, GPUs, on/off-chip memory, interconnects, I/O system,
energy/power, etc.). PAPI enables users to see, in near real time, the
relations between software performance and hardware events across the entire
computer system.

[The ECP Exa-PAPI project](https://icl.utk.edu/exa-papi/) builds on the latest
PAPI project and extends it with:

* Performance counter monitoring capabilities for new and advanced ECP
  hardware, and software technologies.
* Fine-grained power management support.
* Functionality for performance counter analysis at "task granularity" for
  task-based runtime systems.
* "Software-defined Events" that originate from the ECP software stack and are
  currently treated as black boxes (i.e., communication libraries, math
  libraries, task-based runtime systems, etc.)

The objective is to enable monitoring of both types of performance
events---hardware- and software-related events---in a uniform way, through one
consistent PAPI interface. Third-party tools and application developers will
have to handle only a single hook to PAPI in order to access all hardware
performance counters in a system, including the new software-defined events.

# Contributing

The PAPI project welcomes contributions from new developers. Contributions can
be offered through the standard GitHub pull request model. We strongly
encourage you to coordinate large contributions with the PAPI development team
early in the process.

**For timely pull request reviews and feedback, it is important to submit 
one (1) pull request per feature / bug fix.**

In order to create a pull request on a public read-only repo, 
you will need to do the following:

1. Fork the PAPI repo (click "+" on the left and "Fork this repository").

2. Clone it.

3. Make your changes and push them.

4. Click "create pull request" from your repo (not the PAPI repo).
