Philosophy:

  Man pages are the lowest common denominator for PAPI documentation.
  Currently, all PAPI functionality is first documented as a man page.
  From there, it is converted into a collection of linked html pages
  using the perl script in this directory. Additionally, using tools
  in the /papi/doc directory, it is also converted into a Programmer's
  Reference and formatted as a Word .doc file, a PDF file, a PostScript
  file, and a single html file. All these formats are accessible on the
  PAPI website.
  Any content changes or additions must be made to the man pages and
  propagated forward from there.
