.TH PAPI_COST 1 "May, 2005"
.SH NAME
papi_cost \- computes execution time costs for basic PAPI operations.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpapi_cost\fP [\fI-dhs\fP] [\fI-b bins\fP] [\fI-t threshold\fP]


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpapi_cost\fP is a PAPI utility program that computes the min / max / mean / std. deviation 
of execution times for PAPI start/stop pairs and for PAPI reads.
This information provides the basic operating cost to a user's program 
for collecting hardware counter data. Command line options control display capabilities.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fI-b <bins>\fP
Define the number of bins into which the results are partitioned for display. The default is 100. 

.TP
\fI-d\fP
Display a graphical distribution of costs in a vertical histogram.

.TP
\fI-h\fP
Display help information about this utility.

.TP
\fI-s\fP 
Show the number of iterations in each of the first 10 standard deviations above the mean.

.TP
\fI-t <threshold>\fP 
Set the threshold for the number of iterations to measure costs. The default is 100,000.

.SH BUGS 
There are no known bugs in this utility. 
.LP
If you find a bug, it should be reported to the PAPI Mailing List at <ptools-perfapi@ptools.org>.
