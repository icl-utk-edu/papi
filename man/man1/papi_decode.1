papi_decode \- provides availability and detail information for PAPI preset events.

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpapi_decode\fP [\fI-ah\fP]


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpapi_decode\fP is a PAPI utility program that converts the PAPI presets for the existing library into 
a comma separated value format that can then be viewed or modified in spreadsheet applications or text editors,
and can be supplied to 
.BR "PAPI_encode_events" "(3) as a way of adding or modifying event definitions for specialized applications."
The format for the csv output consists of a line of field names, followed by a blank line, followed by one
line of comma separated values for each event contained in the preset table. A portion of this output 
(for Pentium 4) is shown below:
