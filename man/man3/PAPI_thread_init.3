\fBPAPI_thread_init\fP initializes thread support in the PAPI library\&. Applications that make no use of threads do not need to call this routine\&. This function MUST return a UNIQUE thread ID for every new thread/LWP created\&. The OpenMP call omp_get_thread_num() violates this rule, as the underlying LWPs may have been killed off by the run-time system or by a call to omp_set_num_threads() \&. In that case, it may still possible to use omp_get_thread_num() in conjunction with PAPI_unregister_thread() when the OpenMP thread has finished\&. However it is much better to use the underlying thread subsystem's call, which is pthread_self() on Linux platforms\&.
