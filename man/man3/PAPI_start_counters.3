\fIPAPI_EINVAL\fP One or more of the arguments is invalid. 
.br
\fIPAPI_EISRUN\fP Counters have already been started, you must call PAPI_stop_counters() before you call this function again. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ESYS\fP A system or C library call failed inside PAPI, see the errno variable. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOMEM\fP Insufficient memory to complete the operation. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ECNFLCT\fP The underlying counter hardware cannot count this event and other events in the EventSet simultaneously. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOEVNT\fP The PAPI preset is not available on the underlying hardware.

PAPI_start_counters() starts counting the events named in the *events array. This function cannot be called if the counters have already been started. The user must call PAPI_stop_counters() to stop the events explicitly if he/she wants to call this function again. It is the user's responsibility to choose events that can be counted simultaneously by reading the vendor's documentation. The length of the *events array should be no longer than the value returned by PAPI_num_counters().
