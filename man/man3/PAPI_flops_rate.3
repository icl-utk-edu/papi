\fBReturn values\fP
.RS 4
\fIPAPI_EINVAL\fP The counters were already started by something other than PAPI_flops_rate()\&. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOEVNT\fP The floating point operations event does not exist\&. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOMEM\fP Insufficient memory to complete the operation\&.
.RE
.PP
The first call to PAPI_flops_rate() will initialize the PAPI interface, set up the counters to monitor the floating point operations event and start the counters\&.
.PP
Subsequent calls will read the counters and return real time, process time, floating point operations and the Mflop/s rate since the latest call to PAPI_flops_rate()\&.
.PP
PAPI_flops_rate() returns information related to theoretical floating point operations rather than simple instructions\&. It uses the floating point operations event which attempts to 'correctly' account for, e\&.g\&., FMA undercounts and FP Store overcounts\&. Note that PAPI_flops_rate() is thread-safe and can therefore be called by multiple threads\&.
