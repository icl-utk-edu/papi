\fIPAPI_EINVAL\fP The counters were already started by something other than PAPI_epc()\&.

\fIPAPI_ENOMEM\fP Insufficient memory to complete the operation\&.

The first call to PAPI_epc() will initialize the PAPI interface, set up the counters to monitor the user specified event, PAPI_TOT_CYC, and PAPI_REF_CYC (if it exists) and start the counters\&.
.PP
Subsequent calls will read the counters and return real time, process time, event counts, the core and reference cycle count and EPC rate since the latest call to PAPI_epc()\&.
.PP
PAPI_epc() can provide a more detailed look at algorithm efficiency in light of clock variability in modern cpus\&. MFLOPS is no longer an adequate description of peak performance if clock rates can arbitrarily speed up or slow down\&. By allowing a user specified event and reporting reference cycles, core cycles and real time, \fBPAPI_epc\fP provides the information to compute an accurate effective clock rate, and an accurate measure of computational throughput\&. Note that PAPI_epc() is thread-safe and can therefore be called by multiple threads\&.
