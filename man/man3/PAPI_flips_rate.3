\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIevent\fP one of the three presets PAPI_FP_INS, PAPI_VEC_SP or PAPI_VEC_DP 
.br
\fI*rtime\fP realtime since the latest call 
.br
\fI*ptime\fP process time since the latest call 
.br
\fI*flpins\fP floating point instructions since the latest call 
.br
\fI*mflips\fP incremental (Mega) floating point instructions per seconds since the latest call
.RE
.PP
\fBReturn values\fP
.RS 4
\fIPAPI_EINVAL\fP The counters were already started by something other than PAPI_flips_rate()\&. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOEVNT\fP The floating point instructions event does not exist\&. 
.br
\fIPAPI_ENOMEM\fP Insufficient memory to complete the operation\&.
.RE
.PP
The first call to PAPI_flips_rate() will initialize the PAPI interface, set up the counters to monitor the floating point instructions event and start the counters\&.
.PP
Subsequent calls will read the counters and return real time, process time, floating point instructions and the Mflip/s rate since the latest call to PAPI_flips_rate()\&.
.PP
PAPI_flips_rate() returns information related to floating point instructions using the floating point instructions event\&. This is intended to measure instruction rate through the floating point pipe with no massaging\&. Note that PAPI_flips_rate() is thread-safe and can therefore be called by multiple threads\&.
