PAPI_register_thread() should be called when the user wants to force PAPI to initialize a thread that PAPI has not seen before\&.
.PP
Usually this is not necessary as PAPI implicitly detects the thread when an eventset is created or other thread local PAPI functions are called\&. However, it can be useful for debugging and performance enhancements in the run-time systems of performance tools\&.
